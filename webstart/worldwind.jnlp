        Specifies the resources required by the World Wind SDK core library:
        * World Wind core JAR file.
        * World Wind GDAL JAR file. World Wind must include the GDAL JAR file on its class path, even when the GDAL
          native libraries are not used. We include the GDAL JAR file at the GDAL webstart site to avoid a version
          conflict should the application choose to include the GDAL Web Start component.
        * JOGL version 2.0 Web Start component. World Wind depends on the JOGL library to communicate with the platform
          native OpenGL libraries.
        * WebView native library JAR archives for Mac OS X, Windows 32-bit and Windows 64-bit. The WebView native
          libraries are required by implementations of the World Wind BrowserBalloon class.
        * Disable the use of DirectDraw by Java2D on Windows. This is necessary for correct operation of JOGL on Windows
          and is accomplished by setting the sun.java2d.noddraw property to true. See the JOGL Userguide for details:
